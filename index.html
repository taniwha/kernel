Just some quick links.

<p><a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">djgpp</a> stuff
<p><a href="ed.tar">ed</a>     My own editor for djgpp.  The tar file is uncompressed
because it's really a collection of .zip files.  Requires
<a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> and
<a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/">zlib</a>.  Vaguely (?:) similar to
Borland's ide, but (IMHO) better, even though it's not finished yet (doesn't support
spawning yet (eg running gcc), and the python integration is currently lowsy).  Nice
features include the ability to read gziped files and file size is effectively
unlimited (reads linux-2.0.33.tar.gz without any problems, memory permitting).
<p><a href="orb.zip">orb</a>    3D N-body gravitational orbit simulator. Uses allegro
(sorry, can't find the url at the moment, but there's a link in the djgpp pages).
<p><a href="serio.zip">serio</a>  The latest version of my serial port code.
An older version can be had from
<a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2tk/bcsio20.zip">SIMTEL</a>
<p><a href="lfn.zip">M$ DOG LFN driver</a>  My (very unfinished) LFN driver
(alpha, 0.1.3). Needs a much hacked version of DJ Delorie's
<a href="djasm.zip">djasm</a>.
<p><a href="kernel.zip">kernel</a>  My
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">djgpp</a> built os-kernel.  Doesn't actually
do anything yet, but can be uses as a starting point.  Requires a working C and C++
capable <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">djgpp</a>, GNU bison, and
<a href="djasm.zip">djasm</a>.

Linux stuff
<p>Umm, not a lot yet, sorry.  I've ported my editor to linux, but who want's a suid
root editor that's console only?  If you do want it,
<a href="mailto:bill@taniwha.tssc.co.nz">mail me</a>, and I'll mail you the sources.
<p>Also, <a href="djasm.zip">djasm</a> builds and works under Linux, but I don't
imagine many people want it for Linux.
<hr>
<p>I am willing to answer any questions about my software, or even just
<a href="mailto:bill@taniwha.tssc.co.nz">chat</a> :).
No, taniwha can <i>not</i> be reached by the outside world, other than via mail
(I have a local network address).

<p><a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP</a>  The greatest DOS development
environment out there.
<p><a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>  The greatest OS out there.
