--------D-2153-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ internal - TRANSLATE BIOS PARAMETER BLOCK TO DRIVE PARAM BLOCK
	AH = 53h
	DS:SI -> BIOS Parameter Block (see #1004)
	ES:BP -> buffer for Drive Parameter Block (see #0742 at AH=32h)
Return: ES:BP buffer filled
Notes:	for DOS 3.0+, the cluster at which to start searching is set to 0000h
	  and the number of free clusters is set to FFFFh (unknown)
	if the number of sectors per cluster is set to zero, MS-DOS will hang
	  at startup because it computes the internally-used shift count by
	  shifting this value right until the carry flag is set; since this
	  will never happen when the field is zero, MS-DOS hangs
	not supported by Windows NT 3.1

Format of BIOS Parameter Block:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 1004)
 00h	WORD	number of bytes per sector
 02h	BYTE	number of sectors per cluster
 03h	WORD	number of reserved sectors at start of disk
 05h	BYTE	number of FATs
 06h	WORD	number of entries in root directory
 08h	WORD	total number of sectors
		for DOS 4.0+, set to zero if partition >32M, then set DWORD at
		  15h to actual number of sectors
 0Ah	BYTE	media ID byte (see #0703)
 0Bh	WORD	number of sectors per FAT
---DOS 2.13---
 0Dh	WORD	number of sectors per track
 0Fh	WORD	number of heads
 11h	WORD	number of hidden sectors
---DOS 3.0+ ---
 0Dh	WORD	number of sectors per track
 0Fh	WORD	number of heads
 11h	DWORD	number of hidden sectors
 15h 11 BYTEs	reserved
---DOS 4.0+ ---
 15h	DWORD	total number of sectors if word at 08h contains zero
 19h  6 BYTEs	???
 1Fh	WORD	number of cylinders
 21h	BYTE	device type
 22h	WORD	device attributes (removable or not, etc)
---DR DOS 5+ ---
 15h	DWORD	total number of sectors if word at 08h contains zero
 19h  6 BYTEs	reserved
---European MS-DOS 4.00---
 15h	DWORD	total number of sectors if word at 08h contains zero
		(however, this DOS does not actually implement >32M partitions)

Format of Extended BIOS Parameter Block:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 3300)
 00h 25 BYTEs	same as standard DOS 4-6 BPB (see #1004)
 19h	DWORD	sectors per FAT if WORD at 0Bh is 0000h
 1Dh	WORD	extended flags
		bits 3-0: the 0-based FAT number of the active FAT
		bits 6-4: reserved (0)
		bit 7: do not mirror active FAT to inactive FATs
 1Fh	WORD	file system version (high byte=major, low byte=minor)
 21h	DWORD	starting cluster number of root directory
 25h	WORD	file system information sector number (see also #3296)
 29h  6 WORDs	reserved
